### Bug of the week

[Bug 18485 - 'Object' menu layer commands ungroup and regroup objects](http://quality.livecode.com/show_bug.cgi?id=18343)

This bug is a really interesting problem where the 'Object â†’ Bring to front'
menu item (and other object ordering menu commands) can modify the group
structure of objects.

Each time the bug is reproduced using the sample stack, it's necessary to put
the sample stack back into its original configuration, including relayering and
regrouping the controls.  The reporter realised this and kindly included a
"Reset" button that makes preparing for testing the problem very easy!
