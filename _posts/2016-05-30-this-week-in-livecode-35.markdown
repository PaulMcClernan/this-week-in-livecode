### Bug report of the week

[Bug 17747 - Widgets do not respond to mouse events in popup stacks](http://quality.livecode.com/show_bug.cgi?id=17747)

This report is particularly helpful because:

- it has a clear and descriptive title.
- it contains a *simple* sample stack that clearly demonstrates the problem
- it contains detailed step-by-step instructions on how to replicate the bug.
- it clearly states what is the **expected** and what is the **observed** result
- it contains an example where the same recipe does *not* cause a bug.

### Notable changes

* [Search for LCB extensions](https://github.com/livecode/livecode/pull/4043): Now LCB widgets and libraries can be detected automatically by the standalone Builder
* [Make using curly braces a syntax error](https://github.com/livecode/livecode/pull/4047): The undocumented subscript syntax `tArray{"key"}` has been removed
* [Fix field chunk addition logic](https://github.com/livecode/livecode/pull/4050):
