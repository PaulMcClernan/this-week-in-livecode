### Bug of the week

[Bug 17275 - altKey combo code not working with rawKeyDown using scanners](http://quality.livecode.com/show_bug.cgi?id=17802)

- The simple and effective example stack clearly demonstrates the problem.
- Excellent support/responsiveness from the reporter, who sent us all the
  required elements (even hardware from the USA!) to test for this bug
- Although the bug affected only an edge case, the excellent engagement from
  the reporter encouraged the development team to implement a fix much sooner
  than originally planned!
