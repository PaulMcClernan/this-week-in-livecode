### Bug of the week

[Bug 18221 - cameraControl image size incorrect & reversed](http://quality.livecode.com/show_bug.cgi?id=18221)

This bug details a size difference between images displayed by the
camera control when viewing front and back cameras on iOS.

This is the bug of the week because its reporter provided a very 
helpful stack illustrating the problem and a detailed, reproducible
recipe and some useful screenshots to demonstrate the issue.
