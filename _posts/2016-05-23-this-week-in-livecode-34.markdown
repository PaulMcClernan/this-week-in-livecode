## Updates from the LiveCode open source community

### News & blog posts

There have been several blogs about the ongoing crowdfunding campaign to fund
language-level enhancements to the LiveCode Builder compiler and virtual
machine.  These changes will make it easier to wrap arbitrary native code
libraries using LiveCode Builder, and all of the improvements will go directly
into the LiveCode open source project.

At the time of writing, the base funding for the project has been reached, as
has the "SQLite library" stretch goal.
